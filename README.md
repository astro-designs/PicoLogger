PicoLogger
==========
A multi purpose data logger for the Raspberry Pi Pico
Designed to capture data from a variety of sensors and log to a Domoticz server

### Installation instructions for the Raspberry Pi Pico:

1. Clone this folder
   
2. Install the latest version of MicroPython with WiFi on the Pico

3. Use an IDE such as Thonny to upload the folder to the Pico

4. Edit sensors.py to define the sensors and configuration

Note: I used Thonny 3.3.10 for Windows to manage the files on the Pico and edit / develop the code.
